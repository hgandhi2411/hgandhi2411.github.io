After being averse to extracurricular reading for the longest time, I picked it up in 2018. A simple strategy that helped me read more was setting a goal of reading just 5 minutes everyday. This made it easier to start and I ended up reading for longer on most days. With the option of audiobooks, it got even easier ðŸ˜‰! Here is a list of books I have read so far.
