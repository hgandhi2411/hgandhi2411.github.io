Dr. Heta A. Gandhi is a Machine Learning Scientist at Nurix Therapeutics, where she leverages her expertise to integrate advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance drug discovery and development. Her role involves data analysis of DNA-encoded library (DEL) data and property profiling using ML and AI techinques for small molecules as well as degraders and molecular glues. Heta received her PhD in Chemical Engineering at the University of Rochester, under the guidance of by Dr. Andrew White at the [WhiteLab](http://thewhitelab.org/). Her expertise lies in application of computational modeling tools to solve problems in the chemistry and chemical engineering fields. Past work includes applying explainable AI (XAI) and natural language processing (NLP) for molecular property prediction and chemical data analysis, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study biomolecules, and statistical modeling to study the potential of energy systems. Heta has also dabbled in the mixed reality space (augmented and virtual reality) for development of tools for chemical education.

Beyond her research, she seeks out activites that challenge her. Some interests include going on outdoor adventures, long distance running, playing volleyball and badminton and reading.
