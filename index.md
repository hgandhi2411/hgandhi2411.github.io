I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Rochester, being advised by Dr. Andrew White at the [WhiteLab](http://thewhitelab.org/). My expertise lies in application of computational modeling tools to solve problems in the chemistry and chemical engineering fields. This includes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study biomolecules, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to make sense of chemical data, and statistical modeling to study the potential of energy systems. I have also dabbled in the mixed reality space (augmented and virtual reality) for development of tools for chemical education. Read about all my interesting work in the [publications](https://hgandhi2411.github.io/publications/) tab! Recently, I got an opportunity to intern at Nurix Therapeutics where I learned about DNA encoded libraries and drug screening. 

Outside of my research, I like taking up activities that help me get out of my comfort zone. Some of my many interests are going on outdoor adventures, and reading non-fiction [books](https://hgandhi2411.github.io/books/). Latest addition to that list is sketching, still a novice though.
